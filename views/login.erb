			<p> Hi <%= user %>, you should be able to visit the wiki or TEPID and have them work automagically </p>
			<a href="https://tepid.science.mcgill.ca/wiki/">Visit the wiki</a><br>
			<a href="https://tepid.science.mcgill.ca/"> Visit TEPID</a><br>
			<p> Gitblit <i>almost</i> works, but there are problems with logout because it's hosted on .sus. rather than .science. Once Gitlab is back up, ctf-sso will handle authentication there too and it should not have this problem. </p>
			<a href="http://git.sus.mcgill.ca">Visit Gitblit anyway</a><br>
			<p> You can also choose to click <a href="/sso/logout">here</a> to logout.
